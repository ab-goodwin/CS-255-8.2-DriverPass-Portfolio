# CS-255 DriverPass Portfolio
**Who is the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**<br>
 The client is 'DriverPass'. They aimed to build a new driver's education system to help new drivers prepare to take their official driver's tests. This new system would allow students to schedule appointments with certified driving instructors, take practice tests, and provide resources for students to prepare for their driving test and exam

**What did you do particularly well?**<br>
I believe I did the use case scenarios well. I took the interview notes and successfully transitioned those requirements into use cases, determining relationships, and mapping out the functions.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**<br>
Out of all the parts of the documents, determining the functional and nonfunctional requirements is where I struggled the most, and I think I would improve that section of the Business Requirements Document. I didn't quite understand the difference between the two, and what differentiates a functional requirement from a nonfunctional requirement. Now knowing the difference between the two, going back and reassessing the requirements will improve that Business Requirements Document.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**<br>
I carefully analyzed the interview transcript for the client's requirements. I determined which of those are system requirements and external requirements, and focused ont the requirements related to the software's functionality.
I separated the design into smaller, and more manageable tasks and use cases, gradually working towards the more complex tasks by using include and extend relationships to help simplify development. 
Taking user needs into account not only improves and streamlines the development but also improves the client's satisfaction by delivering a product that fully meets their expectations.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**<br>
When designing software, I like to try and get a minimal functioning prototype and receive feedback on that, and make improvements and refine it as I develop. I get the requirements and functions down before I make it look nice, and more user-friendly. Future analysis would be starting with determining the requirements in a functional vs. nonfunctional list, and  then developing the use case diagram, and activity diagrams for the use cases. I find the activity diagrams to be the most useful technique for guiding the development process.
